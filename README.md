nojs
====

Definitive scalable JavaScript library for the web.

Tired of all the JavaScript libraries to choose from? Tired of figuring out how you'll test all that client side JavaScript? Tired of "fixing" your pristine JavaScript for that "other" browser. You need the nojs library, the last JavaScript framework you'll ever use.

Features:
====
1. No need for import statements.
2. No need for testing frameworks.
3. No special API to memorize.

To use the nojs library you simply just delete all of your inline JavaScript, all of your JavaScript files, all your JavaScript tests, and all of your JavaScript include tags. Simply replace them with pure HTML and modify your server-side code. That's it!


Buzzwords:
===
Highly Scalable, Easy, Rapid.
